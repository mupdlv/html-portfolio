    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hey there, I'm Dylan, your friendly neighborhood web wizard hailing from
      the heart of Texas, Fort Worth to be exact! A Texan through and through, I
      sprouted up in Azle, spent my formative years there, and even got my
      diploma from Azle High School.
    </p>
    <p>
      Post-graduation, I dipped my toes in the college pool over at Howard Payne
      University for a hot minute, but the siren call of the real world
      beckoned, leading me to a colorful array of full-time gigs. Picture this:
      yours truly as the maestro of munchies, aka the restaurant general manager
      at the local Pizza Hut in Brownwood, for a solid 3-4 year stint.
    </p>
    <p>
      But hey, life's an adventure, right? A sprinkle of burnout combined with
      the joyful arrival of my nephews courtesy of big sis Courtney, and I
      decided to shift gears, heading closer to the family hub in the vibrant
      DFW area. And here I stand!
    </p>
    <p>
      At 29, I'm on the lookout for exciting opportunities in the web
      development realm. Whether it's freelancing or joining a rad team, as long
      as I'm coding my heart out, you'll find me grinning ear to ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when I'm not conjuring code, you'll catch me in the throes of various
      passions. From conquering virtual worlds in gaming, to pounding the
      pavement on a run, or diving headfirst into the world of languages, I'm
      always up to something. Plus, let's not forget my knack for crafting
      eye-popping videos and images â€“ I'm a regular editing maestro!
    </p>
    <p>
      So, pull up a virtual chair and let's dive into the digital wonderland
      together!
